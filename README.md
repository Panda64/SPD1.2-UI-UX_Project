# SPD1.2-UI_UX_Project
 
This is a design mockup/prototype of a workout app I came up with earlier this year. 


Here is quote from my initial thoughts on this idea:

"11/18/2020 — A workout app. Yesterday I was trying to find an app where a group of friends could workout together from their homes, but couldn’t find anything quite like I was looking for. Ideally, you and your friends could create a group, and do workouts from there. Someone would select the workouts to do (there would be preset workouts with pictures along with the ability to add custom ones) along with the sets and reps, with each member of the group checking off whether or not they did it. Maybe even have an option where the workout would unlock at a certain time so that everybody could be working out and doing the same thing at once."


NOTE: THIS MOCKUP WAS DESIGNED FOR MOBILE VIEWING ON GITHUB PAGES @ https://panda64.github.io/SPD1.2-UI-UX_Project/  AS THIS IS INTENDED TO BE A MOBILE APP. VIEWING THIS MOCKUP ON A BIGGER SCREEN WILL CAUSE THINGS TO LOOK DIFFERENT.

I don't know if this is something I will ever pursue fully fleshing out, but here it is nevertheless.
